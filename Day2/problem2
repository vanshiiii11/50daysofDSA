🔹 Problem
Maximum Product Subarray
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/?source=submission-ac

Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Approach
We keep track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at the current index because multiplying
by a negative number can swap their roles. For each element, we compute the new max and min using 
the current value and previous products, and update the global maximum.
